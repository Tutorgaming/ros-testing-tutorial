     An integration exercise.
     1) Modify counter_node so it can be started with any number. 
        It should be loaded by a ros_param on init.

     2) Create a Factorial node that receives the input from counter_node 
        and publishes the factorial of the received number

     3) Demonstrate that the system works using an integration test.
