ros-tdd-tutorial
===============

ROS files and exercises for the ros-tdd seminar I gave to the Social Robots Group on march 2014

First, check the [presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eraurS9rlMXyN0kbQMJdCyWOxRC5JTBV7FskyMaYNpM/present)

The repository contains 3 ROS packages:

* **ros-gtest-samples**: Examples borrowed from Gtest documentation and adapted to work with ROS
* **rostest_node_sample**: A couple of Gtest examples extended to work as a node. A rosiest file is provided
* **integration_exercise**: An exercise proposal that asks you to test at library, node and integration levels.
